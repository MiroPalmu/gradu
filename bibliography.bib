	abstract = {Runko is a new open-source plasma simulation framework implemented in C++ and Python. It is designed to function as an easy-to-extend general toolbox for simulating astrophysical plasmas with different theoretical and numerical models. Computationally intensive low-level kernels are written in modern C++ taking advantage of polymorphic classes, multiple inheritance, and template metaprogramming. High-level functionality is operated with Python scripts. The hybrid program design ensures good code performance together with ease of use. The framework has a modular object-oriented design that allows the user to easily add new numerical algorithms to the system. The code can be run on various computing platforms ranging from laptops (shared-memory systems) to massively parallel supercomputer architectures (distributed-memory systems). The framework supports heterogeneous multiphysics simulations in which different physical solvers can be combined and run simultaneously. Here we showcase the framework's relativistic particle-in-cell (PIC) module by presenting (i) 1D simulations of relativistic Weibel instability, (ii) 2D simulations of relativistic kinetic turbulence in a suddenly stirred magnetically-dominated pair plasma, and (iii) 3D simulations of collisionless shocks in an unmagnetized medium.},

We present general-relativistic collisionless plasma simulations of Kerr-black-hole magnetospheres which begin from vacuum, inject electron-positron pairs based on local unscreened electric fields, and reach steady states with electromagnetically powered Blandford-Znajek jets and persistent current sheets. Particles with negative energy-at-infinity are a general feature, and can contribute significantly to black-hole rotational-energy extraction in a variant of the Penrose process. The generated plasma distribution depends on the pair-creation environment, and we describe two distinct realizations of the force-free electrodynamic solution. This sensitivity suggests that plasma kinetics will be useful in interpreting future horizon-resolving submillimeter and infrared observations.},

We derive an analytic model for the direct electron heating by the externally driven antenna electric field, and we confirm that it approximates well the electron heating obtained in the simulations. In the simulations, transient waves accelerate electrons in a sheath surrounding the antenna. This increases the Larmor radii of the electrons close to the antenna, and more electrons can reach the antenna location to interact with the externally driven fields. The resulting hot electron sheath is dense enough to support strong waves that produce high‐energy sounder‐accelerated electrons (SAEs) by their nonlinear interaction with the ambient electrons. By increasing the emission amplitudes in our simulations to values that are representative for the ones of the sounder on board the OEDIPUS C (OC) satellites, we obtain electron acceleration into the energy range which is comparable to the 20 keV energies of the SAE observed by the OC mission. The emission also triggers stable electrostatic waves oscillating at frequencies close to the first harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency. We find this to be an encouraging first step of examining SAE generation with kinetic numerical simulation codes.},

The wealth of observational data collected by the AGILE and Fermi gamma-ray space telescopes in the GeV range, and by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes in the TeV band provide invaluable insights into how relativistic plasmas dissipate and accelerate particles. Decoding the information contained in the gamma-ray pulses profile is an important step to understand how pulsars work. In this study, we aim at putting an ab initio plasma model of pulsar magnetospheres to the test, in light of the most recent gamma-ray observations in the GeV and TeV bands. To this end, we present of a new series of global particle-in-cell simulations of an inclined pulsar magnetosphere. High-quality synthetic pulse profiles in the synchrotron and inverse Compton channels are reconstructed to study in greater details their morphology and their energy dependence. We also perform a fit of observed lightcurves with the model, using the third Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar catalog. Reconnection in the wind current sheet powers synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The modeled pulse profiles reproduce some of the salient features of observed gamma-ray pulsars, including the mysterious Vela-like lightcurves, such as: the generic double-peaked structure, the presence of a bridge or third peak in between the main pulses, the pulse narrowing with increasing energy. The bolometric synchrotron radiative efficiency is strictly limited by the reconnection rate. Our global kinetic simulations are able to match observed pulse profiles. Such direct comparisons will help drive and focus future simulation developments.},

We provide a detailed description of the main sub-algorithms of the novel PIC algorithm, including a charge-conserving current deposit scheme for curvilinear coordinates. We demonstrate efficient particle acceleration in the polar caps of compact neutron stars with denser magnetospheres, numerically validating the spacelike current extension provided by force-free models. We show that GR relaxes the minimum required poloidal magnetospheric current for the transition of the polar cap to the accelerator regime, thus justifying the observation of weak pulsars beyond the expected death line. We denote that spin-down luminosity intermittency and radio pulse nullings for older pulsars might arise from the interplay between the polar and outer gaps.

When a black hole is immersed in an externally supplied magnetic field, reconnection of magnetic field lines within the ergosphere can generate negative energy (relative to infinity) particles that fall into the black hole event horizon while the other accelerated particles escape stealing energy from the black hole. We show analytically that energy extraction via magnetic reconnection is possible when the black hole spin is high (dimensionless spin a ∼1 ) and the plasma is strongly magnetized (plasma magnetization σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&gt;1 /3 ). The parameter space region where energy extraction is allowed depends on the plasma magnetization and the orientation of the reconnecting magnetic field lines. For σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≫1 , the asymptotic negative energy at infinity per enthalpy of the decelerated plasma that is swallowed by a maximally rotating black hole is found to be ɛ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-∞{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≃-√\{σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/3 \}.

A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of \$a\_*{\textbackslash}sim\$0.1-0.2. Furthermore, the spins in the first-born black holes appear lower than in the second-born ones. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high, \$a\_*{\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.7\$. This is the case, in particular, for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0, while their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to \$a\_*{\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.7\$ by accretion, but only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, we find the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into the incident and reflected ones, which is intrinsically highly uncertain. The method of spectral fitting accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models give the disk temperatures higher than the standard models, and consequently predict lower spins. We postulate that the published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. We hypothesize that the spins of the binaries with high-mass donors are low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high, including high spins as required to power relativistic jets.},

This is followed by a comparison of the three integrators in terms of accuracy and error. A fitness parameter is then proposed that can serve as a one-stop value to determine which method is more suitable for a particular simulation setup. It is hoped that through knowledge of such intricacies, the choice for the integrator will be easier to make depending on the problem at hand.},

In this paper we demonstrate the unique challenges involved in preparing the VPIC code for operation at exascale, outlining important optimizations to make VPIC efficient on accelerators. Specifically, we show the work undertaken in adapting VPIC to exploit the portability-enabling framework Kokkos and highlight the enhancements to VPIC's modeling capabilities to achieve performance at exascale.

	abstract = {A simple similarity has been proposed for kinetic (e.g., particle-in-cell) simulations of plasma transport that can effectively address the longstanding challenge of reconciling the tiny Debye length with the vast system size. This applies to both transport in unmagnetized plasma and parallel transport in magnetized plasmas, where the characteristics length scales are given by the Debye length, collisional mean free paths, and the system or gradient lengths. The controlled scaled variables are the configuration space, \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}/{\textbackslash}mathscr\{L\},\$ and artificial collisional rates, \${\textbackslash}mathscr\{L\}μ\$, which is realized through scaling the Coulomb Logarithm in the simulations, \${\textbackslash}mathscr\{L\}{\textbackslash}ln Λ.\$ Whereas, the scaled time, \$t/{\textbackslash}mathscr\{L\}\$, and electric field, \${\textbackslash}mathscr\{L\}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{E\}\$, are automatic outcomes. The similarity properties are examined, demonstrating that the macroscopic transport physics is preserved through a similarity transformation while keeping the microscopic physics at its original scale of Debye length. To showcase the utility of this approach, two examples of 1D plasma transport problems were simulated using the VPIC code: the plasma thermal quench in tokamaks [J. Li, et al., Nuclear Fusion {\textbackslash}textbf\{63\}, 066030 (2023)] and the plasma sheath in the high-recycling regime [Y.

	abstract = {New hardware architectures open up immense opportunities for supercomputer simulations. However, programming techniques for different architectures vary significantly, which leads to the necessity of developing and supporting multiple code versions, each being optimized for specific hardware features. The oneAPI framework, recently introduced by Intel, contains a set of programming tools for the development of portable codes that can be compiled and fine-tuned for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and accelerators. In this paper, we report on the experience of porting the implementation of Boris particle pusher to oneAPI. Boris particle pusher is one of the most demanding computational stages of the Particle-in-Cell method, which, in particular, is used for supercomputer simulations of laser-plasma interactions. We show how to adapt the C++ implementation of the particle push algorithm from the Hi-Chi project to the DPC++ programming language and report the performance of the code on high-end Intel CPUs (Xeon Platinum 8260L) and Intel GPUs (P630 and Iris Xe Max). It turned out that our C++ code can be easily ported to DPC++. We found that on CPUs the resulting DPC++ code is only {\textasciitilde}10\% on average inferior to the optimized C++ code. Moreover, the code is compiled and run on new Intel GPUs without any specific optimizations and shows the expected performance, taking into account the parameters of the hardware.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2508.05727},
	abstract = {In this review, we examine particle transport in strongly turbulent three-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasmas, characterized by intense (large-amplitude) magnetic field fluctuations. Such environments naturally give rise to a network of coherent structures (CoSs), including current sheets, filaments, shocks, switchbacks, and significant magnetic perturbations, which critically influence particle dynamics at the kinetic level. Within this turbulent regime, two fundamental particle energization mechanisms emerge, stochastic acceleration and systematic acceleration. Systematic acceleration within open turbulent volumes promotes the development of power-law tails in energy distributions. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of two electric fields: the perpendicular (or convective) fields, which drive stochastic heating via interactions with randomly moving scatterers, and the parallel electric fields, which enable systematic particle acceleration in regions of strong currents. Combined with accurate estimates of particle escape times in finite volumes, the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the formation of Kappa distributions. The transport properties differ significantly between the two energization modes. Stochastic energization follows Gaussian statistics and can be effectively described by the Fokker-Planck equation. In contrast, systematic acceleration exhibits Levy flight statistics, necessitating a fractional transport equation for an accurate description. Furthermore, the fractal spatial distribution of CoSs introduces deviations from traditional transport models, influencing e.g. particle escape times. Systematic acceleration is most efficient during the early, high-energy phases of turbulence, while stochastic heating becomes dominant during the later stages, contributing to gradual particle energization.},

	abstract = {The interest in relativistic beam-plasma instabilities has been greatly rejuvenated over the past two decades by novel concepts in laboratory and space plasmas. Recent advances in this long-standing field are here reviewed from both theoretical and numerical points of view. The primary focus is on the two-dimensional spectrum of unstable electromagnetic waves growing within relativistic, unmagnetized, and uniform electron beam-plasma systems. Although the goal is to provide a unified picture of all instability classes at play, emphasis is put on the potentially dominant waves propagating obliquely to the beam direction, which have received little attention over the years. First, the basic derivation of the general dielectric function of a kinetic relativistic plasma is recalled. Next, an overview of two-dimensional unstable spectra associated with various beam-plasma distribution functions is given. Both cold-fluid and kinetic linear theory results are reported, the latter being based on waterbag and Maxwell-Jüttner model distributions. The main properties of the competing modes (developing parallel, transverse, and oblique to the beam) are given, and their respective region of dominance in the system parameter space is explained. Later sections address particle-in-cell numerical simulations and the nonlinear evolution of multidimensional beam-plasma systems. The elementary structures generated by the various instability classes are first discussed in the case of reduced-geometry systems. Validation of linear theory is then illustrated in detail for large-scale systems, as is the multistaged character of the nonlinear phase. Finally, a collection of closely related beam-plasma problems involving additional physical effects is presented, and worthwhile directions of future research are outlined.},

While it has been known for long that a flow-aligned magnetic field can completely quench the instability, it was recently proved in 2D that in the cold regime, such cancelation is possible if and only if the field is perfectly aligned. Here, this result is finally extended to a 3D geometry. Calculations are conducted for symmetric and asymmetric counter-streaming relativistic plasma shells. 2D results are retrieved in 3D: the instability can never be completely canceled for an oblique magnetic field. In addition, the maximum growth-rate is always larger for wave vectors lying in the plan defined by the flow and the oblique field. On the one hand, this bears consequences on the orientation of the generated filaments. On the other hand, it certifies 2D simulations of the problem can be performed without missing the most unstable filamentation modes.},

	abstract = {The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method has been developed by Oscar Buneman, Charles Birdsall, Roger W. Hockney, and John Dawson in the 1950s and, with the advances of computing power, has been further developed for several fields such as astrophysical, magnetospheric as well as solar plasmas and recently also for atmospheric and laser-plasma physics. Currently more than 15 semi-public PIC codes are available which we discuss in this review. Its applications have grown extensively with increasing computing power available on high performance computing facilities around the world. These systems allow the study of various topics of astrophysical plasmas, such as magnetic reconnection, pulsars and black hole magnetosphere, non-relativistic and relativistic shocks, relativistic jets, and laser-plasma physics. We review a plethora of astrophysical phenomena such as relativistic jets, instabilities, magnetic reconnection, pulsars, as well as PIC simulations of laser-plasma physics (until 2021) emphasizing the physics involved in the simulations. Finally, we give an outlook of the future simulations of jets associated to neutron stars, black holes and their merging and discuss the future of PIC simulations in the light of petascale and exascale computing.},

	abstract = {This study considers the instabilities that result when an electron beam is injected into a plasma. A number of different models of the system are considered, and all instabilities are classified according to whether they are convective instabilities (amplifying waves) or nonconvective (absolute) instabilities. The study also analyzes the instabilities in unbounded beam-plasma systems and in systems of finite extent transverse to the electron stream and gives a detailed consideration of the possibility of a strong interaction with the ions in a hot-electron plasma. In addition, the author presents mathematical criteria for identifying absolute instabilities and amplifying waves. These criteria are based only on an analysis of the dispersion equation of the system and are not restricted to beam-plasma systems.
            wo things need to be said about this book: the chapter on absolute and convective instabilities makes an important contribution to the field. Second, it should be pointed out that the theoretical results are reduced to a form which make them readily available to an experimentalist. Plasma physicists and electronic engineers will be interested in this work.},

The mixed modes are followed to their saturation for the case of Γ=4 and electron phase space holes are shown to form in the bulk plasma, while the electron beam becomes filamentary. The initial saturation is electrostatic in nature in the considered one- and two-dimensional geometries.

Besides confirming earlier findings that wave power initially peaks on the mixed mode branch, it is observed that during late time evolution, wave power is transferred to other wave numbers. It is argued that the isotropization of power in wavenumber space may be a consequence of weak turbulence. Further, some modifications to the ideal weak turbulence limit is observed. Development of almost isotropic predominantly electrostatic—partially electromagnetic—turbulent spectra holds relevance when considering the spectral emission signatures of the plasma, namely, bremsstrahlung—partially magnetobremsstrahlung (synchrotron radiation and jitter radiation)—from relativistic shocks in astrophysical jets and from shocks in gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei.},

The velocity distribution, Debye shielding, drag on fast and slow sheets, diffusion in velocity space, the Landau damping of the Fourier modes, the amplitude distribution function for the Fourier modes, and the distribution of electric fields felt by the sheets were obtained for the plasma in thermal equilibrium and compared with theoretically predicted values. In every case, except one, the drag on a slow sheet, the numerical results agreed with theory to within the statistical accuracy of the results. The numerical results for the drag on a slow sheet were about a factor of 2 lower than the theory predicated indicating that the approximations made in the theory are not entirely valid.

abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a well established method for solving the time evolution of Maxwell’s equations. Unfortunately the scheme introduces numerical dispersion and therefore phase and group velocities which deviate from the correct values. The solution to Maxwell’s equations in more than one dimension results in non-physical predictions such as numerical dispersion or numerical Cherenkov radiation emitted by a relativistic electron beam propagating in vacuum. Improved solvers, which keep the staggered Yee-type grid for electric and magnetic fields, generally modify the spatial derivative operator in the Maxwell–Faraday equation by increasing the computational stencil. These modified solvers can be characterized by different sets of coefficients, leading to different dispersion properties. In this work we introduce a norm function to rewrite the choice of coefficients into a minimization problem. We solve this problem numerically and show that the minimization procedure leads to phase and group velocities that are considerably closer to c as compared to schemes with manually set coefficients available in the literature. Depending on a specific problem at hand (e.g. electron beam propagation in plasma, high-order harmonic generation from plasma surfaces, etc.), the norm function can be chosen accordingly, for example, to minimize the numerical dispersion in a certain given propagation direction. Particle-in-cell simulations of an electron beam propagating in vacuum using our solver are provided.},

	abstract = {Time-centered, hence second-order, methods for integrating the relativistic momentum of charged particles in an electromagnetic field are derived. A new method is found by averaging the momentum before use in the magnetic rotation term, and an implementation is presented that differs from the relativistic Boris Push only in the method for calculating the Lorentz factor. This is shown to have the same second-order accuracy in time as that found by splitting the electric acceleration and magnetic rotation (Boris Push) and that found by averaging the velocity in the magnetic rotation term (Vay's method) [J.-L. Vay, Phys. Plasmas 15, 056701 (2008)]. All three methods are shown to conserve energy when there is no electric field. The Boris Push and the current method are shown to be volume-preserving, while Vay's method and the current method preserve the E→×B→ velocity. Thus, of these second-order relativistic momentum integrations, only the integrator introduced here both preserves volume and gives the correct E→×B→ velocity. While all methods have error that is second-order in time, they deviate from each other by terms that increase as the motion becomes relativistic. Numerical results show that Vay's method develops energy errors near resonant orbits of a test problem that neither volume-preserving integrator does.},

They are derived using finite elements in both space and time. These new numerical schemes offer considerable advantages over the currently used finite difference PIC methods. They are charge and energy conserving, have good dispersive properties and are computationally fast. Their finite element derivations allow them to be applied to complex geometries more readily than their finite difference PIC counterparts. The local nature of their discrete equations is ideally suited to massively parallel computer architectures. In this paper, an outline of the general derivation is given. One and two dimensional cases are treated in some detail, and the extension to three dimensions is discussed. Procedures for lumping and noise reduction (using a transverse current adjustment - TCA), both of which result in substantial speedups, are outlined. The name “virtual particle” arises from an interpretation of the current assignment scheme.},

We derive a semi-discrete Poisson bracket, which retains the defining properties of a bracket, anti-symmetry and the Jacobi identity, as well as conservation of its Casimir invariants, implying that the semi-discrete system is still a Hamiltonian system. In order to obtain a fully discrete Poisson integrator, the semi-discrete bracket is used in conjunction with Hamiltonian splitting methods for integration in time. Techniques from finite element exterior calculus ensure conservation of the divergence of the magnetic field and Gauss’ law as well as stability of the field solver. The resulting methods are gauge invariant, feature exact charge conservation and show excellent long-time energy and momentum behaviour. Due to the generality of our framework, these conservation properties are guaranteed independently of a particular choice of the finite element basis, as long as the corresponding finite element spaces satisfy certain compatibility conditions.},

It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.},

The accreted gas forms an accretion disk around the black hole and emits x-ray radiation in two distinct modes: hard and soft state. The origin of the states is unknown. We perform radiative plasma simulations of the electron-positron-photon corona around the inner accretion flow. Our simulations extend previous efforts by self-consistently including all the prevalent quantum electrodynamic processes. We demonstrate that when the plasma is turbulent, it naturally generates the observed hard-state emission. In addition, we show that when soft x-ray photons irradiate the system—mimicking radiation from an accretion disk—the turbulent plasma transitions into a new equilibrium state that generates the observed soft-state emission. Our findings demonstrate that turbulent motions of magnetized plasma can power black-hole accretion flow coronae and that quantum electrodynamic processes control the underlying state of the plasma.},
