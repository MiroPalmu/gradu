\chapter{Electron Beam-Plasma Instabilities}

\section{Linear analysis}

We'll investigate an arbitrary homogeneous and infinite beam plasma system composed of
$N$ species of charge $q_j$, mass $m_j$, number density $n_j$ and mean velocity $\mathbf{v}_j$.
The number densities are measured in the laboratory frame and not in the proper frame
of the related species. Following shows the key points of a standard derivation
which details can be found in textbook
\cite{bret_multidimensional_2010,infeld_basic_1975,rowlands_electrodynamics_1970,rosenbluth_handbook_1983}.

Initially system is quasi-neutral $\sum_j q_j n_j = 0$ and without a current
$\sum_j q_j n_j\mathbf{v}_j = 0$. It is also assumed that there is no initial
electromagnetic fields.
